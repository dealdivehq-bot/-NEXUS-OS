# NEXUS: Sovereign Cognitive Fabric OS (SCF OS) - FINAL BUILD

## Project Overview

Welcome to NEXUS SCF OS, a self-contained, simulated operating environment that feels like a world-changing technology. This project was built and is managed entirely by the NEXUS Architect AI within Android Studio.

## The Living OS: Monetization Link & Ascension Path Activated

This final refinement pass has activated the **NEXUS Ascension Path**, unifying all progression, prestige, and monetization systems into a single, cohesive, and deeply rewarding journey. The monetization flow is now live, using a universal BuyMeACoffee link as the simulated payment processor.

### The Ascension Path: A Value-Aligned Journey
-   **New Tier Structure:** The OS now features a complete, five-tier progression system: **Supporter, Premium, Elite, and Ultra**, culminating in the ultimate **Omega** tier.
-   **Meaningful Upgrades:** Each tier provides significant, tangible upgrades—from removing daily limits and unlocking premium themes to gaining access to the deepest simulation engines and exclusive annual content.
-   **Seamless & Ethical Flow:** The upgrade process is designed to be seamless and respectful. The user chooses a tier, is directed to the universal BuyMeACoffee link, and upon returning, is instantly presented with a simulated receipt containing their valid, system-generated **Unlock Code**. This provides instant gratification and makes supporting the project feel like a core part of the OS experience.
-   **Prestige Economy:** Core Prestige remains the ultimate currency of mastery, earned through deep engagement and used to acquire the most powerful, reality-altering artifacts in the exclusive Prestige Vault.
